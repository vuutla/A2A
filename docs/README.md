# A2A Docs

## Published A2A docs

https://google.github.io/A2A

## Developing A2A docs

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into the repo directory
2. Run `pip install -r requirements-docs.txt`
3. Run `mkdocs serve`, edit `.md` files, and live preview
4. Contribute docs changes as usual

## How it works

- The A2A docs use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the
  [mkdocs-material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
- All of the source documentation / Markdown files related to the A2A docs are
  in the `docs/` directory in the A2A repository
- `mkdocs.yml` in the repository root contains all of the docs config, including
  the site navigation and organization
- There is a GitHub Action in `.github/workflows/docs.yml` that builds and
  publishes the docs and pushes the built assets to the `gh-pages` branch in
  this repo using `mkdocs gh-deploy --force`. This happens automatically for all
  commits / merges to `main`.
- The A2A documentation is hosted in GitHub pages, and the settings for this are
  in the A2A repo settings in GitHub.
